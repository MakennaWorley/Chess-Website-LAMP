# Chess-Website-PHP
Final Project for CMPT307 Databases

This has be modified since I first turned this in to work locally on my own Mac using MAMP and not relying on the CS server. Other than that, no changes have been made since submission.

Making use of PHP and a MySQL database, I created a website that interacts with a SQL database for searching, adding, updating and deleting entries in the relationship database.
